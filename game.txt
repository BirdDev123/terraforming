Let's make a game!
  name:Terraforming
  author:BirdDev
  desc:Terraforming is a game that takes place after the game Cookie Clicker. A company known as Sugarhigh Industries has taken over the world, with one goal: make cookies. This, inevitably brought the end of the world, bringing alien monsters known as the Grandmatriarchs. After the founder of Sugarhigh Industries passed away, the remaining survivors warred against the Grandmatriarchs for several years. They were successful, and the aliens left, but the world was still in peril.
Enter you. You are the head of A.R.I., also known as Apocalypse Rehabilitation Industries. You, being a government official, are tasked with returning the world back to normal.
